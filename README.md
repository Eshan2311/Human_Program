# Human_Program
This program is basicallly a bot , which is designed to perform some tasks for the user. These task basically involves running some application fro the user.
In this python program i've used pyttsx3 , os and webbrowser library from python to perform the task .
Here i've created 2 programs: Human Program(windows) & Human Program(macOS). This is because, the os.system command works differently on both the os. 
In windows you can easily add the path in default to run the application through python commands , but in case of MacOS you have to give complete path for every application. Also in MacOS, you can't run pre indtalled applications like TextEdit, safari, messages, Music because the permission is not given to some external application like anaconda jupyter notebook , so we can only run the apps which are later installed in ths os like chrome, zoom, ms office, whatsapp.
